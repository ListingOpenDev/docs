Creating a listing is very straightforward. To get started, visit the [Create Listings](https://listingopen.com/listings/new) page.

### Details

To start, you will be asked to select a [listing category](/listings/categories) and to use a [listing template](/automations/listing-templates). These are entirely optional.

Next, you will be asked to enter the address of the property, and to upload photos.

These photos will play as a slideshow in the background of your open house sign-in page.

### Sign-In

Next, you will be asked to create your sign-in questions. You can either use a [sign-in preset](/automations/sign-in-presets) or [manually add questions](/listings/questions).

### Integrations

Next, you will be asked to add integrations. You can either use an [integration package](/automations/integration-packages) or manually add integrations.

### Design

Finally, you will be able to customize the design of your sign-in page. Once you are satisfied, click "Next".

### Review

Review your listing details and make changes if necessary. Once you are satisfied, click "Save & Publish".
