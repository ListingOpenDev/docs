**Agents** are able to manage and create their own listings, leads, and automations. They cannot access organization-wide settings or view other members' data.

**Managers** are able to oversee all agents within the organization. They can access agents' data (listings, leads, automations) but have no administrative control.

**Owners** have full control over the organization's members, and can remove agents and manage organization settings.
