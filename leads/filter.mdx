After [viewing leads](/leads/view), you are able to effectively filter them. To get started, press the "Filter" button.

## Listing Visited

If you are viewing all your leads, you are able to add listings to filter by.

## Contact Provided

If selected, leads will be filtered out if they failed to provide this contact detail.

For example, selecting "Phone Number" will result in visitors who did not provide their phone numbers being removed from results.

## Sign-In Answers

You can filter leads by their answers to sign-in questions.

To get started, click on a question and select a required answer (or multiple!). You'll know the filter has been activated when the border of the question turns purple.
